# GaleTransforms

Gale transforms are a method to visualize and determine information about high dimensional polytopes. At its core, the Gale Transform of a d dimensional polytope with n vertices is a basis of the null space of the (d+1) x n dimensional matrix where the first d rows have the vertex points as columns, and the last row is 1s.
